## Project Title – Speech to Text using Python
## Domain of project - AI
## Problem Statement
In this project implement intelligent system that translates human speech to text.
## Lab Environment – 
Python 3.x, jupyter notebook, VS Code Editor
## Description of Project – 
Speech Input Using a Microphone and Translation of Speech to Text
####	Allow Adjusting for Ambient Noise: Since the surrounding noise varies, we must allow the program a second or too to adjust the energy threshold of recording so it is adjusted according to the external noise level.
####	Speech to text translation: This is done with the help of Google Speech Recognition. This requires an active internet connection to work. However, there are certain offline Recognition systems such as PocketSphinx, but have a very rigorous installation process that requires several dependencies. Google Speech Recognition is one of the easiest to use.
